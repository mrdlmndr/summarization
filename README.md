Summarization Of Online Conversations
In the recent past the communication of users through social media has seen an exponential increase. A substantial chunk of information exchange happens in the form of online conversations. Such forums contain a lot of information which can benefit organizations as well as information-seeking users. these forums suffer from the problem of information overload and redundancy, where similar topics get discussed multiple times by different users. Summarization is a proven effective way to tackle these problems. An effective summary provides the main topics of discussion by removing redundant and unwanted information from the conversation. In this project, we summarized email threads, i.e., coherent exchanges of email messages among several participants.
